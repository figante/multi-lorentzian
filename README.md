Here you'll find two .xcm files for Xspec to fit simultaneously:    

Power spectrum band 1 (PS1)    
Power spectrum band 2 (PS2)    
Real part of the cross spectrum of band 1 vs. band 2 (RE)    
Imaginary part of the cross spectrum of band 1 vs. band 2 (IM)    

The .xcm file for the [constant phase-lags model](https://github.com/figante/multi-lorentzian/blob/main/example_constant_phase_lags.xcm) uses a linear combination of Lorentzians 
to fit PS1 and PS2 and a combination of Lorentzians multiplied by the cosine (sine) of a 
parameter (the phase lag) to fit the RE (IM) part of the cross spectrum.    

The .xcm file for the [constant time-lags model](https://github.com/figante/multi-lorentzian/blob/main/example_constant_time_lags.xcm) uses a linear combination of Lorentzians 
to fit PS1 and PS2 and a combination of Lorentzians multiplied by the cosine (sine) of a 
parameter (the time lag) times 2 \pi the frequency (in Xspec the energy) to fit the RE (IM) part of the cross spectrum.    

Both .xcm files also read the phase-lag (PL) spectrum and the coherence function (CF)    
and compute the derived model of these two on the basis of the model fitted to   
PS1, PS2, RE and IM.
